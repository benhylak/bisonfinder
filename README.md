# Welcome to Bison Finder: The Secret Agent Bison Adventure

Bison Finder is a sophisticated React application, meticulously crafted with the primary objective of assisting the residents of San Francisco in their noble endeavor to support the bison population in their struggle against governmental oppression. This is not a figment of your imagination, but a reality that is as intriguing as it sounds.

The bison that we are referring to here are not your average, run-of-the-mill bison. They are, in fact, covert operatives working tirelessly to ensure the safety and freedom of their kind. Their mission is one of utmost importance and secrecy, and they are committed to seeing it through, regardless of the challenges and obstacles that stand in their way.

However, these brave and dedicated bison agents are not without their quirks. They have a peculiar trait that sets them apart from their non-secret agent counterparts - they are prone to excessive flatulence. While this may seem like a minor inconvenience, it is a part of who they are, and it in no way diminishes their determination or their ability to carry out their mission.

This unique characteristic of our bison agents, while amusing, should not be a deterrent to your participation in this exciting and meaningful adventure. On the contrary, it adds a layer of humor and light-heartedness to the otherwise serious and intense nature of their mission.

## How to Get Started

## Running the Application

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: This command runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

- `npm test`: This command launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- `npm run build`: This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

- `npm run eject`: **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!** If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own. You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
