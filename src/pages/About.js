        <h1>About Bison</h1>
        <p>
        Bison, also known as buffalo, are large mammals native to North America and Europe. 
        They are known for their strength and resilience. Bison have played a crucial role in 
        the ecosystems they inhabit, contributing to the biodiversity and health of the grasslands.
        </p>
        <p>
        This website is dedicated to providing information about bison, their habitats, and conservation efforts.
        Our goal is to raise awareness and promote the protection of these magnificent creatures.

        <h2>Farts and Bison</h2>
        <p>
        Bison, like all mammals, do fart. Their farts, also known as flatulence, are a natural part of their digestive process. 
        While it may seem humorous, bison farts actually contribute to the methane gas in the atmosphere. 
        However, it's important to note that the methane produced by bison is significantly less than that produced by human activities.
